step 1: Rotate motors
step 2: Read motors position without minding the offset
step 3: Record each motor's offset using a potentiometer and read motors position after reading the values from the potentiometers and configuring offsets
step 4: Calculating the real-life maximum range of each motor and reading an interpreted percentage of the motors position
step 5: Using bluetooth low energy (BLE), to control the motors remotely using a joystick
step 6: Adapt the Arduino code for the ESP32-C3 SuperMini microcontroller
step 7: combine step 6 and step 4
